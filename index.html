        <h4><b>TalkRN</b></h4> 
        <p>TalkRN is a web chatting application build on Node.js and Express.js. Features include auto-moderation, moderation commands, and roles/ranking with minimal code modification. Banning and muting are included, as are moderators and owner only commands. Oh, and AI bots and flairs!<br><br>You *need* Replit to run this, as ReplDB and Repl Auth are involved.</p>

          <h4><b>DoxrForm</b></h4> 
          <p>DoxrForm is a small project I worked on. It features a very simple form for the user, and a minimal admin panel with certain cool powers. There is authentication for the admin, and it is encouraged to modify the form to your own needs.<br><br>This is more for a casual "contact me" form than it is a form for quizzes, simply because of how it was built.</p>
